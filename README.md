are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
